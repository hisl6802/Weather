# Weather measurements

The purpose of this Repository is to create a weather module which is compatible with a Young's Weather Station set-up in order to calculate 
and upload weather measurements. 

The settings file provides easy access to specifying the port and baudrate for serial reading, while the new_eqns module will allow the user to add a function pointer to weather_utils and averaging and then have new weather measurement added to there upload to the Wunderground website.
